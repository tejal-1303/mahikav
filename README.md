# Why this app
In India, there were around 28k harassment or rape cases reported in 2020 which went up to 31k in 2021 but every year around 1 â€“ 2 lacs of woman are harassed which are left unreported due to lack of evidence of the same leading to suicides due to the trauma they go through in their society. Mahika app helps in getting evidence by auto recording feature by tapping volume up or volume down button two times to record the voice of the incident. Even in a panic situation, a person can record it and it will send it to nearby police with the name and current location automatically after 1 minute if the auto-sending is not declined. If anyone has visual proofs or audio proofs then they can send it to community.
